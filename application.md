#### 1) Tell us about the world as you see it 
*A description of the status quo and context in which you will be working*

**We are faced with a serious crisis of trust in scientific research.** Public opinion polls show declining confidence in research. Anti-vaccination movements and climate change deniers are on the rise. In several areas such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), only a minority of society trusts scientific findings.

This is almost paradoxical, given the fact that research is still a respected profession, and there is elevated interest in science and technology. And more research is openly available than ever: we can now read well over 100 million research articles on the Web.

At the same time, it is hard to keep up with research. Access does not equal discoverability or even understandability of research. Due to the speed of innovation, science and technology are perceived to be progressing too fast. In addition, scientific research usually does not allow for participation of outsiders. It is easy to contribute to a conspiracy theory: just enter the respective group online and start communicating. But with a scientific theory, things are not so simple.

People outside academia trying to understand a research field are therefore often lost. This is true for policy makers attempting to optimize decision-making by using evidence from relevant research, for educators striving to convey the state-of-the-art, for journalists trying to get an overview of a research area, or for patients who would like to learn about the newest findings on their illness.


#### 2) What change do you want to make in the world?
*A description of what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your personal vision for this area*

**I want to empower people inside and especially outside of academia - such as teachers, fact checkers, citizen scientists, learners, patients, practitioners, journalists, and others - by dramatically improving the discoverability of scientific knowledge.**

For this to happen, we need to:

1. increase visibility of research findings. Getting an overview of a research field and being able to identify a set of relevant findings pertaining to one's information need are prerequisites for fact checking, evidence-based practice and self-directed learning alike.
1. turn discovery into a collaborative process. At the moment, we are all approaching discovery on our own – and therefore repeat the same process over and over again. By sharing the results of our discoveries, we can guide each other through the literature.

I propose to use knowledge maps, a powerful tool for exploration and discovery. Knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a field by showing the main areas of the field at a glance, and papers related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information.

Around these maps, I envision a space for participatory knowledge mapping where different individuals and communities come together; for example, researchers and medical librarians can collaboratively map the newest research on a certain disease and openly share result of their efforts for the benefit of evidence-based practice and patients affected by this disease.

#### 3) What has prevented this change from happening? 

*Describe the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year*

I am not starting this work from scratch: I have been developing Open Knowledge Maps, a visual interface to the world’s scientific knowledge, with an international group of volunteers for over a year. We have released the results as a public good on [https://openknowledgemaps.org](https://openknowledgemaps.org)

In its current form, Open Knowledge Maps creates a knowledge map for a research topic based on a 100 million research articles. With this service, we have created a lot of excitement in the community. We were featured on the front pages of Reddit and HackerNews, and our user base has quickly grown: we recorded over 100,000 visits to the site, and more than 30,000 maps have been created to date.

We have now reached the limit of what we can do as a volunteer project. During the fellowship year, I would want to explore how to to turn discovery into an open and collaborative process. How can we further develop the existing service to create an inclusive space for participatory discovery? How can different communities interact on a level-playing field, so that they create pathways through science for each other?

To the best of my knowledge, no one has attempted a similar project before. There are, however, several closed solutions for providing visual overviews that are being developed right now. This shows that time is critical: if we do not provide an open alternative soon, we risk being stuck with proprietary solutions and wasted public money for decades.

#### 4) What are you going to do to get there? 

*A description of what you actually plan to do during the year*

**Develop Open Knowledge Maps into a collaborative discovery system:** we will establish an edit mode that allows users to modify and annotate maps, and to create links between papers and areas. The editing history will be preserved in a Wikipedia-like model to enable collaborative building of knowledge maps. We will also add integration with existing tools in the open digital ecosystem, including the Open Science Framework, Zotero, and ORCiD to make it easy to add content to the maps, and to export the maps into other tools. In addition, we will further broaden our coverage of content sources, including non-publication resources such as datasets and images.

**Engage with a diverse set of communities:** to create an inclusive space for participatory discovery, we need to involve users at every step of the process. In addition to our established workshop series, I will initiate a participatory user programme to guide the development of Open Knowledge Maps in a human-centered design process. Another concrete action is to establish mapping parties (similar to those in the Open Street Maps project), where people get together to jointly map an underrepresented research field, e.g. a neglected disease.

**Lay the foundations for a self-sustainable organisation:** my goal is to develop Open Knowledge Maps into a building block of the open knowledge society. Therefore, I will address challenges such as organizational development and a sustainable funding stream together with our advisors.
 

#### 5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

**If we build it, will they come?** We already see considerable interest in the project (see above), so that the question at the moment is how to realize its full potential. I will address this challenge by following the practices detailed in section 4: human-centered design and constant engagement with the community.

**A strong and diverse community:** I will face this key challenge by leveraging knowledge of the advisory board and partner community, including Wikimedia and Open Knowledge, as well as the Shuttleworth community. I will also rely on experience that I have gained as one of the founders of Barcamp Graz, and as a coordinator of the Open Science WG of Open Knowledge AT. In both cases, we have have established strong communities based on openness and inclusiveness.

**Technical challenges related to building a large-scale system:** in this respect, I will draw on my longstanding experience in software engineering (16 years, thereof 8 years as a project manager), and the experience of my team. It will be crucial to address scalability from the start and build it into the core architecture. We will use a distributed agile process and adopt strategies of successful open source projects.

**Creating a self-sustainable non-profit organization:** my involvement with nonprofit organizations in the past 9 years (thereof 3 years as chairperson) has made me conscious of the challenges that are connected to that. Again, I will gather advice from advisors, partners and the Shuttleworth community.

#### 6) What part does openness play in your idea?

**My motto is: "Open science, all the way"**. Open Knowledge Maps strives to be a building block of the open knowledge society by sharing data, source code, and content under a license that is compatible with the Open Definition. The code will be made available under the license of the existing project (LGPL v3). All maps will be released under CC BY - with the exception of the contained content, which of course retains its original license. The underlying knowledge structures will be mapped to Wikidata concepts and can be exported in various open formats under CC0, so that they can be easily re-used.

We have established a network of 10 partner organisations, including rOpenSci, ContentMine, Hypothes.is, Wikimedia and Open Knowledge, as well as an international advisory board. I will actively involve our partners and advisors throughout the project. My goal is to reuse as much of the existing ecosystem as possible. To achieve this, the project progress is openly shared with the world, including this proposal and our project’s roadmap, which are both hosted on Github. The development also takes place on Github. The concrete targets for developing the system are published as issues in our repositories.

Openness will also play an important role in all social activities, which will be organized in the spirit of other open knowledge events. Mapping parties, for example, will be free of charge and they will be open to everyone interested in collaborative knowledge discovery.
